# DriftBottle — a real-world message game (no internet needed)

**DriftBottle** is an adventurous message-sharing system inspired by the old romantic idea of throwing bottles with messages into the sea.  
Tiny devices called **DriftBots** exchange messages directly — with no internet involved.  
Imagine a digital bottle that floats from person to person, passed physically when devices come into contact.  
Just you, other people, and invisible wireless waves.

## 🌊 How it works

You carry a small **DriftBot** — built with a Raspberry Pi Zero and an e-ink display.  
When it comes close to another DriftBot, they automatically exchange messages — “bottles.”

Each message can:
- Be addressed to a specific person or region;
- Be locked (only the recipient can read it) or public;
- Have a lifespan (after which it “shatters on the rocks”);
- Carry a digital reward — experience, points, or local currency.

## ⚓ The core idea

Message delivery happens **in the real world**.  
You walk, meet people — and your devices make digital handshakes like tiny wireless captains.  
**DriftBottle turns everyday movement into a playful adventure**, and each exchange into a moment of discovery.

## 📜 The Philosophy

**DriftBottle isn’t just about delivering messages.**  
It’s a digital adventure in the real world — where every bottle tells a story.  
Like the ocean, you never know where a message will end up —  
but if it arrives, someone made it happen.
